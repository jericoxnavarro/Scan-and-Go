Now a days every stores and business establishments are required to have a logbook to record the names and monitor the visitors for contact tracing. With this manual log book system people tend to forget to bring their own ballpen so they share ballpen to write their information. Because of that, the virus is more likely easier to spread.

Me and my team present to you our solution with an app named Scan & Go. This app promotes faster contract tracing and helps the store monitor the list of costumers using their mobile phones.
The scan and go app implements social distancing by making sure that no physical Contact is occurring. With the help of this app, a simple scan of the unique QR Code will log you in and give your basic information. No more writing in the log books, no more holding other peopleâ€™s ballpen, and yes to easy log in.
